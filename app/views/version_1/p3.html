        There are improvements to the flood defences in this area, we expect the flood likelihood in this area to change on 1 April 2020.
         <br/><br/>
        The Pulteney weir is being decommissioned in this area and the flood risk will be updated in June 2020.
         <br/><br/>
        The repair to the Bathampton Meadows culvert and flood storage area is underway and will be completed by October 2019.
