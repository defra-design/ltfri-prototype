                  We use the best data available to estimate the rivers and sea flood risk for <strong>an area</strong>.
                  <br><br>
                  We cannot tell you whether an individual property will definitely flood.
                  <br><br>
                  The information takes into account any flood defences. They can help reduce the chance of flooding but cannot completely prevent it because:

                  <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>they can fail</li>
                    <li>water could spill over the top if it is deep enough</li>
                  </ul> 
                 
                  Neighbouring houses in a street may have different levels of flood risk. This could be because one is on higher land or has higher floor levels.
                  <br><br>
                  Predicting flood risk is not an exact science - flood events of any size can happen anywhere at any time.
