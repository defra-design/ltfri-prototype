                      Reservoirs are large natural or artificial lakes which collect and store water. They're built with safety measures in place to prevent overflow and flooding.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      We use predicted scenarios to understand the risk of flooding from reservoirs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      Flooding from reservoirs is extremely unlikely. An area is considered at risk if people's lives could be threatened in the event of a dam or reservoir failure.
