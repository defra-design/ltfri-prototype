        <p class="govuk-body">We use computer models to estimate flood risk, based on the best data we have available. The models do not include past flooding as this does not predict whether a flood might happen in the future.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The models do not include every local feature like kerbs, fences and walls. That means we can only tell you the flood risk of the area around a building, not the building itself.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Neighbouring houses in a street may have different levels of flood risk. This could be because one is on higher land or is nearer water, for example.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Flooding is hard to predict, especially further into the future. Flood risks could be bigger or smaller than what we show, and could change over time.</p>
