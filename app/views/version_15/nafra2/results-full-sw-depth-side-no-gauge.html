    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What can happen in a flood</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">At 20cm, flood water can get into some homes and buildings, especially if the property has a basement. At this level, water can also damage your car or cause a breakdown.</p>
   
      <p class="govuk-body">At 30cm, flood water can get into homes and buildings. Water at this level can also move a car, damage roads and cause major traffic disruption.</p>
   
      <p class="govuk-body"> At 60cm, flood water can float most vehicles, including 4x4s.</p>
   
  

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-3">Adapt your home or business to the risk of flooding</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You cannot completely protect your home or business against flooding, but there's a lot you can do to reduce:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the amount of flood water that gets in</li>
      <li>the damage from flood water</li>
      <li>the cost and time of cleaning up after a flood</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood protection measures are usually effective up to 60cm. You should not try and keep flood water out of buildings if it's over 90cm. Water at this level can cause collapse or permanent structural damage.</p>
